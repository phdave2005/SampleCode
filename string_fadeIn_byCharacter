//A combination of PHP's str_split() and javascript can slice up any string character by character and initialize the string
as visibility:hidden or display:none, and then have the string be spelled out character-by-character for a nice visual effect

//The PHP
<?php
$SplitInit = str_split($myString); //$myString is the string you want to have appear character-by-character
$SplitCount = count($SplitInit);
$SplitString = ''; //Here is the string you will have displayed to the user, initially an empty string

for ($i = 0; $i < $SplitCount; $i++) {
    $SplitUsername .= "<span id='myStringSpan".($i + 1)."' style='display:none'>".$SplitUser[$i]."</span>";
}
?>//Notice that the string of interest has been slice into characters separated by <span></span> and each
character has been set to display:none. Each character has an alphanumeric id that begins with myStringSpan, followed by an
integer that increments with each iteration of the for loop

//The Javascript

//The following function is bound to any event, but the alpha portion of the string id and the length of the string must
be sent. num allows you to start at any character you want:

//for example, <button type="button" onclick="FancyFade('myStringSpan', 500, 1, '<?= $SplitCount ?>')">Click</button> 
allows the user to start at the first character of the myStringSpan series, with each character fading in over the 
course of 500 ms

function FancyFade(id, dur, num, stringcount) {
    if (num < stringcount) {
        $(id + num).fadeIn(dur);
        num++;
        setTimeout(function () {FancyFade(id, dur, num, stringcount);}, 300);
    }
}
    
    
    
    
}
