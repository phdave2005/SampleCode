<!-- On one of my sites, the home page image has been sliced into 44 pieces. The following code fades in each <img> piece 
sequentially (each piece is initalized with a style="display:none" and so the screen is initially blank. The last <img> 
piece fades in more slowly than the rest. Each <img> piece has a unique id "Piece1" through "Piece44". The function 
ImageLoad is bound to a body onload event, as follows -->

<body onload="ImageLoad('1')">

function ImageLoad(num) {
    var newnum = Number(num), delaytime = 800, fadetime = 1200;
    (num === '44') ? $("#Piece" + num).fadeIn(2500) : $("#Piece" + num).fadeIn(fadetime);
    if (NewNum === '44') {
        delaytime = 1600;
    }
    if (newnum < 45) {
        newnum++;
        var NewNum = newnum.toString();
        setTimeout(function () {ImageLoad(NewNum);}, delaytime); //If last piece not faded in, call function for next piece
    }
}
